# Advent of Code 2015

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015).

The puzzles are solved in November 2017 as a warming up for AoC 2017.

I decided to use [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) because I just started exploring it (Python-like syntax, with C-like speeds), and this will be a good practice to improve my Nim skills.  
If you are more experienced in Nim, I would like to hear comments/improvements to my solutions.
